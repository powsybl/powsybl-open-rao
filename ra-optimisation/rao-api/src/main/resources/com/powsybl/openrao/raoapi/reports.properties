# Keys must be alphabetically ordered
openrao.raoapi.reportCappingRelativeMinimumImpactThreshold = The value ${relativeMinImpactThreshold} provided for relativeminimum impact threshold is greater than 1. It will be set to 1.
openrao.raoapi.reportNegativeMaxNumberOfBoundariesForSkippingActions = The value ${maxNumberOfBoundariesForSkippingActions} provided for max number of boundaries for skipping actions is smaller than 0. It will be set to 0.
openrao.raoapi.reportNegativeMinimumObjectiveImprovement = The value ${curativeRaoMinObjImprovement} provided for curative RAO minimum objective improvement is smaller than 0. It will be set to + ${positiveCurativeRaoMinObjImprovement}
openrao.raoapi.reportNegativeRelativeMinimumImpactThreshold = The value ${relativeMinImpactThreshold} provided for relative minimum impact threshold is smaller than 0. It will be set to 0.
openrao.raoapi.reportNegativeSensitivityFailureOvercost = The value ${sensitivityFailureOvercost} for `sensitivity-failure-overcost` is smaller than 0. This would encourage the optimizer to make the loadflow diverge. Thus, it will be set to + ${positiveSensitivityFailureOvercost}
openrao.raoapi.reportRaoVersionAndGitCommit = Running RAO using Open RAO version ${openRaoVersion} from git commit ${gitCommit}.
