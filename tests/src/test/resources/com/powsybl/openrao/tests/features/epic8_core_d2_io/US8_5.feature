Feature: US 8.5: Management of FRM during computation

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 8.5.1: case without FRM
    Given network file is "epic2/US2-3-case1-standard.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic8/12nodes_pst_topo_frm_cbcora_null_frm.xml"
    When I launch search_tree_rao at "2019-01-08 12:00"
    Then the value of the objective function after CRA should be -26.0
    Then the margin on cnec "Cnec1 - preventive" after PRA should be 26.0 A

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 8.5.2: case with a FRM of 50 MW
    Given network file is "epic2/US2-3-case1-standard.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic8/12nodes_pst_topo_frm_cbcora.xml"
    When I launch search_tree_rao at "2019-01-08 12:00"
    Then the value of the objective function after CRA should be 44.0
    Then the margin on cnec "Cnec1 - preventive" after PRA should be -44.0 A
