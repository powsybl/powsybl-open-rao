Feature: US 7.8: Loopflow computation (not within the RAO)

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 7.8.1: optimise network action without loop flow limitation
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic7/crac_lf_rao_2.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere_ac.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "SECURED"
    Then the worst margin is 131.0 A
    Then 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
