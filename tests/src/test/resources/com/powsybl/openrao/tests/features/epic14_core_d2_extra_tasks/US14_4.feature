Feature: US 14.4: HVDC

  @fast @rao @mock @dc @contingency-scenarios @hvdc
  Scenario: US 14.4.1 : Outage HVDC modelling 1 (CORE's Cobra)
    Given network file is "epic14/TestCase12NodesHvdc.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic14/cbcora_ep14us4case1.xml"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao at "2019-01-08 12:00"
    Then the initial margin on cnec "004_FR-DE - outage" should be 501.0 MW
    And the initial margin on cnec "003_FR-DE - curative" should be 501.0 MW
    And the initial margin on cnec "002_FR-DE - preventive" should be 932.0 MW
    And the worst margin is 691.0 MW
    And the margin on cnec "004_FR-DE - outage" after PRA should be 691.0 MW
    And the margin on cnec "003_FR-DE - curative" after CRA should be 857.0 MW
    And the margin on cnec "002_FR-DE - preventive" after PRA should be 1102.0 MW
