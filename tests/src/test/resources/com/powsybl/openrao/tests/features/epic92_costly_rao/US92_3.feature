Feature: US 92.3: Exhaustive costly optimization - APPROXIMATED_INTEGERS PSTs

  @fast @preventive-only @costly @rao
  Scenario: US 92.3.1: Activate one topological action and one PST in preventive
  Two ways to secure the network:
  1. move PST to tap -5 => cost of 25
  2. (optimal) close line BE-FR 2 and move PST to tap -2 => cost of 20
    Given network file is "epic92/2Nodes3ParallelLinesPST2LinesClosed.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic92/crac-92-3-1.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic92/RaoParameters_dc_minObjective_discretePst.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the worst margin is 32.13 MW
    And the value of the objective function initially should be 2000000.0
    And 2 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "pstBeFr3" is used in preventive
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "pstBeFr3" should be -2 in preventive
    And the remedial action "closeBeFr2" is used in preventive
    And the value of the objective function after PRA should be 20.0

  @fast @costly @rao
  Scenario: US 92.3.2: Preventive and curative PST + curative topological action
  The PST is moved to tap -5 to secure the preventive perimeter for a total cost of 95
  (20 for activation + 5 * 15 for variation). Then, there are two ways to secure the curative perimeter:
  1. move PST to tap -7 => cost of 20 + 2 * 15 = 50
  2. (optimal) close line BE-FR 3 and move PST to tap -6 => cost of 10 + 20 + 1 * 15 = 45

  @fast @costly @rao @second-preventive
  Scenario: US 92.3.3: Preventive and curative PST + curative topological action with 2nd preventive optimization
  The PST is moved to tap -6 straight from preventive to only activate the remedial action once.
