Feature: US 15.11.4: ARAO with 2P

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @second-preventive @mnec
  Scenario: US 15.11.4.1: Check that PRAO2 ignores applied ARAs from ARAO1
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes2PSTs.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic15/jsonCrac_ep15us11-4case1.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic15/RaoParameters_ep15us11-4.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    # With the recent development, the RAO falls back to 1st PRAO result
    # because 2PRA increases the cost
    # Then the RAO falls back to 1st preventive RAO result
    Then 2 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "Open line NL1-NL2" is used in preventive
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "PRA_PST_BE" should be -6 in preventive
    And 1 remedial actions are used after "Contingency_FR1_FR3" at "auto"
    And 0 remedial actions are used after "Contingency_FR1_FR3" at "curative"
    And the worst margin is -140 MW
    And the value of the objective function after CRA should be 140
    And the margin on cnec "FR2-FR3-O - preventive" after PRA should be -140 MW
    And the margin on cnec "NL2-BE3-O - curative" after CRA should be 0 MW
    Then the execution details should be "Second preventive improved first preventive results"
