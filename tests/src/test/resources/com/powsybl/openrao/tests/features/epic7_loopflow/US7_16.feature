Feature: US 7.16: monitor loopflows on specific countries

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only @loopflow
  Scenario: 7.16.1 : loopflows monitored on the borders of BE and of NL
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic7/crac_lf_rao_3_cbcora.xml"
    Given loopflow glsk file is "common/glsk_lots_of_lf_12nodes.xml"
    Given RefProg file is "epic7/refProg_12nodes.xml"
    Given configuration file is "epic7/RaoParameters_maxMargin_mw_ac_lf_false_5_100_BE_NL.json"
    When I launch loopflow rao at "2019-01-08 21:30" with default loopflow limit as 0.0 percent of pmax

    Then the worst margin is -143.0 MW
    Then the worst margin is -143.0 MW on cnec "FFR2AA1  DDE3AA1  1 - preventive"
    Then the tap of PstRangeAction "PRA_PST_BE" should be -16 in preventive
    Then the remedial action "Open FR1 FR2" is used in preventive

    And the loopflow threshold on cnec "DDE2AA1  NNL3AA1  1 - preventive" should be 1000.0 MW
    And the initial loopflow on cnec "DDE2AA1  NNL3AA1  1 - preventive" should be -610.0 MW
