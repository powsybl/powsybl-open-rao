Feature: US 5.1: Maximum margin stop criterion

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 5.1.0.a: positive margin stop criterion: secure initially, no ra applied
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic5/SL_ep5us1.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "SECURED"
    Then the worst margin is 500.0 MW
    Then 0 remedial actions are used in preventive

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 5.1.0.b: use relevant number of decimals for margin and cost logging
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic5/SL_ep5us1b.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "UNSECURED"
    Then the worst margin is -0.0001 A with a tolerance of 1E-8 A
    Then 0 remedial actions are used in preventive
