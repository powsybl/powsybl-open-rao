Feature: US 19.2: Handle maximum topological CRA per TSO

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @contingency-scenarios
  Scenario: US 19.2.1: Check that the maximum number of network actions per TSO is ignored in preventive 1
    Given network file is "common/TestCase16Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic19/SL_ep19us2case1.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_ampere.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then 3 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "open_be1_be4" is used in preventive
    And the remedial action "open_fr1_fr2" is used in preventive
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "pst_be" should be -15 in preventive
    Then 1 remedial actions are used after "co1_fr2_fr3_1" at "curative"
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "pst_fr" should be -15 after "co1_fr2_fr3_1" at "curative"
    And the worst margin is -500 A on cnec "FFR1AA1  FFR4AA1  1 - co1_fr2_fr3_1 - curative"
    And the margin on cnec "BBE4AA1  FFR5AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 300 A
