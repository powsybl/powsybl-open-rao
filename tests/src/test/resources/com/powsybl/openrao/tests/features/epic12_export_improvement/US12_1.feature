Feature: US 12.1: handling of curative optimization in the CORE CNE export

  @fast @cne-export @mock
  Scenario: 12.1.1: Simple curative case (copy of scenario 13.3.10)
    Given network file is "epic13/TestCase16Nodes_with_different_imax.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic13/CBCORA_ep13us3case10.xml"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_ampere.json"
    Given RaoResult file is "epic12/RaoResult_12_1_1.json"
    When I export CORE CNE at "2019-01-08 12:59"
    Then the CORE CNE file is xsd-compliant
    Then the exported CNE file is the same as "epic12/ExpectedCNE_12_1_1.xml"
