Feature: US 2.3: Combine range PST and NetworkAction optimization

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 2.3.1: standard optimization
    Given network file is "epic2/US2-3-case1-standard.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic2/SL_ep2us3_pst_and_topological_remedial_actions.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "SECURED"
    Then 2 remedial actions are used in preventive
    Then the tap of PstRangeAction "SelectTapPST43" should be -16 in preventive
    Then the remedial action "CloseLine322" is used in preventive
    Then the worst margin is 26.0 A
    Then the margin on cnec "FFR1AA1  FFR2AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 26.0 A

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 2.3.2: no network actions involved in the best solution
    Given network file is "epic2/US2-3-case2.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic2/SL_ep2us3case2.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "SECURED"
    Then 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    Then the tap of PstRangeAction "SelectTapPST43" should be -16 in preventive
    Then the worst margin is 204.0 A
    Then the margin on cnec "FFR1AA1  FFR2AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 204.0 A

  Scenario: US 2.3.3: systematic sensitivity computation diverge when testing some Network Actions
    Given network file is "epic2/US2-3-case3-networkBecomeDivergent.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic2/SL_ep2us3case3.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "UNSECURED"
    Then 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    Then the tap of PstRangeAction "SelectTapPST43" should be 4 in preventive
    Then the worst margin is -820.0 A
    Then the margin on cnec "FFR1AA1  FFR2AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be -820.0 A
    Then the margin on cnec "FFR1AA1  FFR4AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be -820.0 A
    Then the margin on cnec "FFR4AA1  FFR3AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be -206.0 A
    Then the margin on cnec "FFR4AA1  FFR3AA1  2 - preventive" after PRA should be -779.0 A

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 2.3.4: the systematic sensitivity computation diverges at the root leaf of the tree
    Given network file is "epic2/US2-3-case4-networkDiverge.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic2/SL_ep2us3case4.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the calculation fails
    And the execution details should be "Initial sensitivity analysis failed"
