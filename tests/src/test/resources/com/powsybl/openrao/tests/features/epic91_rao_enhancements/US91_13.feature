Feature: US 91.13: PST Regulation

  @ac @fast @rao
  Scenario: US 91.13.1.a: Unsecure case with a trade-off tap position - PST is the limiting element
  The curative scenario cannot be secured, the curative tap is chosen such that both curative CNECs are overloaded but
  with the lowest global overload reachable. The PST is the most limiting element at the end of curative.
    Given network file is "epic91/2Nodes3ParallelLinesPST.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic91/crac-91-13-1.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic91/RaoParameters_ac.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the tap of PstRangeAction "pstBeFr2" should be -16 in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "cnecBeFr1Preventive" after PRA should be 579.65 A
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "pstBeFr2" should be -2 after "Contingency BE1 FR1 3" at "curative"
    And the value of the objective function after CRA should be 690.23

  @ac @fast @rao @pst-regulation
  Scenario: US 91.13.1.b: Duplicate of US 91.13.1.a with PST regulation
  At the end of curative optimization, the PST is still unsecure but can be secured by moving the tap to position 7
  even if it worsens the minimum margin significantly. Regulation can be performed because the PST is the most
  limiting element.

  Scenario: US 91.13.3.a: 3 contingency scenarios and 3 PSTs with different use cases
  - Scenario 12: PST 34 has a negative margin of -444.08 A so even though PST 12 should go up to -16 to maximize its own
  margin, the minimal margin does not improve below -10 (margin at -9 is about -462 A)
  - Scenario 23: trade-off tap between preventive CNEC and curative PST leading the preventive tap of PST 23 to be -6
  - Scenario 34: automaton secures PST 34 straight from auto instant at tap -15
  Each curative scenario is unsecure with some PSTs overloaded.

  Regulation is performed on PSTs 12 and 34 because they can be moved in curative.
  The regulation tap is either -15 is the contingency was parallel to the PST or -5 otherwise.

  Scenario: US 91.13.4: Regulation with two equivalent parallel PSTs
  The two PSTs are identical. Status quo is not to move any tap leaving both overloaded at the end of curative
  optimization. PST regulation will put both in abutment at tap 16 since the loadflow regulates tap by only focusing on
  one PST instead of the whole network.
