Feature: US 4.2: Optimization in A/MW, thresholds in A/MW, computation in AC/DC

  @fast @rao @mock @dc @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 4.2.1: MW thresholds in DC mode and min margin in MW
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic4/SL_ep4us2_4MR_MW.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the worst margin is 19.0 MW
    And the value of the objective function after CRA should be -19.0
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "PRA_PST_BE" should be 5 in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "FFR2AA1  DDE3AA1  1 - N-1 NL1-NL3 - outage" after PRA should be 27.0 MW
    And the margin on cnec "NNL2AA1  BBE3AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 20.0 MW
    And the margin on cnec "FFR2AA1  DDE3AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 44.0 MW
