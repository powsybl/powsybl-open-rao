Feature: US 7.9: Linear RAO with loopflow limitation

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 7.9.1: linear RAO without LF limitation
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic7/crac_lf_rao_1.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_ampere_ac.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "SECURED"
    And the worst margin is 322.0 A
    And the margin on cnec "FFR1AA1  FFR2AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 322.0 A
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "PRA_PST_BE" should be -16 in preventive

    Then the worst margin is 285.0 A
