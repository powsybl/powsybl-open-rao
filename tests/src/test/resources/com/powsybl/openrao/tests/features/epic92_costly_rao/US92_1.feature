Feature: US 92.1: Costly network actions optimization

  @fast @preventive-only @costly @rao
  Scenario: US 92.1.1: Selection of cheapest of 3 equivalent network actions
    Given network file is "epic92/2Nodes4ParallelLines.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic92/crac-92-1-1.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic92/RaoParameters_dc_minObjective.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the worst margin is 250.0 MW
    And 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "closeBeFr4" is used in preventive
    And the value of the objective function after PRA should be 10.0

  @fast @preventive-only @costly @rao
  Scenario: US 92.1.2: Selection of cheapest network action even if it does not maximize minimum margin
    Line BE-FR-3 has a higher resistance than line BE-FR-2 which means that closing the latter will lead
    to a higher margin on the optimized CNEC. However, closing line BE-FR-3 is cheaper and still secures
    the CNEC so it will be chosen by the RAO.
    Given network file is "epic92/2Nodes3ParallelLines.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic92/crac-92-1-2.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic92/RaoParameters_dc_minObjective.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the worst margin is 83.0 MW
    And 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "closeBeFr3" is used in preventive
    And the value of the objective function after PRA should be 25.0

  @fast @preventive-only @costly @rao
  Scenario: US 92.1.2.bis: Duplicate of 92.1.2 in MAX_MIN_MARGIN mode
    The situation is the same as in US 92.1.2 but the RAO maximizes the minimum margin.
    As activation costs are not taken in account, both lines will be closed.
    Given network file is "epic92/2Nodes3ParallelLines.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic92/crac-92-1-2.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic92/RaoParameters_margin_dc_minObjective.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the worst margin is 464.29 MW
    And 2 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "closeBeFr2" is used in preventive
    And the remedial action "closeBeFr3" is used in preventive
    And the value of the objective function after PRA should be -464.29

  @fast @preventive-only @costly @rao
  Scenario: US 92.1.3: Selection of the two cheapest network actions
    Given network file is "epic92/2Nodes4ParallelLines.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic92/crac-92-1-3.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic92/RaoParameters_dc_minObjective.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the worst margin is 66.67 MW
    And 2 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "closeBeFr3" is used in preventive
    And the remedial action "closeBeFr4" is used in preventive
    And the value of the objective function after PRA should be 720.0

  @fast @preventive-only @costly @rao
  Scenario: US 92.1.4: Selection of cheapest of 3 equivalent network actions but overload remains at the end of RAO
    Only one network action can be used (behavior set in the RAO parameters) so the RAO chooses the cheapest
    remedial action available to reduce the overload and thus the penalty cost. The total cost is:
    100 (overload in MW) * 10000 (penalty cost in currency/MW) + 220 (cost of the chosen remedial action)
    Given network file is "epic92/2Nodes4ParallelLines.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic92/crac-92-1-3.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic92/RaoParameters_dc_minObjective_maxDepth1.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the worst margin is -100.0 MW
    And 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "closeBeFr4" is used in preventive
    And the value of the objective function initially should be 6000000.0
    And the value of the objective function after PRA should be 1000220.0

  @fast @preventive-only @costly @rao
  Scenario: US 92.1.5: Sub-optimal case
    Closing line BE-FR-2 costs 1000 but solves the constraint immediately. The optimal case is to
    close lines BE-FR-3 and BE-FR-4 successively (the order does not matter) for a total expense of 50.
    Yet, because of the penalty cost for overloads, the RAO still counts an over-cost of 100000 because
    closing BE-FR-3 or BE-FR-4 alone only reduce the minimum margin to -100 MW. As closing BE-FR-2 looks optimal
    at depth 1, the greedy search-tree keeps it at depth 2 but there is no need to apply additional remedial
    actions since the network is already secure.
