Feature: US 10.1: Linear RAO with relative margin

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only @relative
  Scenario: US 10.1.1: unsecured case
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic10/ls_relative_margin_unsecure.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic10/RaoParameters_relMargin_megawatt.json"
    Given loopflow glsk file is "common/glsk_proportional_12nodes.xml"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "UNSECURED"
    And the value of the objective function after CRA should be 275.8
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "PRA_PST_BE" should be -16 in preventive
    And the worst margin is -275.8 MW on cnec "FFR1AA1  FFR2AA1  1 - preventive"
    And the relative margin on cnec "NNL2AA1  BBE3AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 2286.2 MW
    And the relative margin on cnec "DDE2AA1  NNL3AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 2474.7 MW
