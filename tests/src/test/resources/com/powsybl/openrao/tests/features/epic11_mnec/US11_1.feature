Feature: US 11.1: Handle mnecs in linear RAO

  @fast @rao @mock @dc @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 11.1.1: reference run, no mnec
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic11/ls_mnec_linearRao_ref.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "SECURED"
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "PRA_PST_BE" should be -16 in preventive
    And PST "BBE2AA1  BBE3AA1  1" in network file with PRA is on tap -16
    And the value of the objective function after CRA should be -224.0
    And the worst margin is 224.0 MW on cnec "FFR1AA1  FFR2AA1  1 - preventive"
    And the flow on cnec "NNL2AA1  NNL3AA1  1 - preventive" after PRA should be 949.0 MW
