Feature: US 7.11: Additional tests with CBCORA input files and FRM

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only @loopflow
  Scenario: 7.11.1 : Replication of test case 7.10.3, using a CBCORA file as input instead of a SL
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic7/crac_lf_rao_3_cbcora.xml"
    Given loopflow glsk file is "common/glsk_lots_of_lf_12nodes.xml"
    Given configuration file is "epic7/RaoParameters_maxMargin_ampere_ac_lf_false_5_100.json"

    When I launch loopflow search_tree_rao at "2019-01-08 00:00" with default loopflow limit as 0.0 percent of pmax
    # if the loopflow limit is defined equal to zero, josiris-server will not create LoopFlowExtensions
    # and the limits given in the CBCORA file will be used instead

    Then its security status should be "UNSECURED"
    Then the worst margin is -669.0 A

    Then the remedial action "Open FR1 FR2" is used in preventive
    And the loopflow threshold on cnec "DDE2AA1  NNL3AA1  1 - preventive" should be 1000.0 MW
