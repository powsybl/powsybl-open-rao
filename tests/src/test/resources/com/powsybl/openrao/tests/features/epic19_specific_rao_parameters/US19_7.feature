  Scenario: 19.7.9.MW.R: Only PSTs - Second most limiting CNEC belongs to an operator not sharing CRAs - MW - relative
    Given network file is "epic19/TestCase16Nodes_with_different_imax.uct" for CORE CC
    Given crac file is "epic19/CBCORA_ep19us7case9.xml"
    Given configuration file is "epic19/RaoParameters_maxRelMargin_megawatt_shareCra_mip.json"
    Given loopflow glsk file is "common/glsk_proportional_16nodes.xml"
    When I launch search_tree_rao at "2019-01-08 12:00" after "CO1_fr2_fr3_1" at "curative"
    Then 2 remedial actions are used after "CO1_fr2_fr3_1" at "curative"
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "pst_be" should be 2 after "CO1_fr2_fr3_1" at "curative"
    And the tap of PstRangeAction "pst_fr" should be -5 after "CO1_fr2_fr3_1" at "curative"
    And the worst relative margin is 578 MW
    And the value of the objective function after CRA should be -578.0
    And the relative margin on cnec "fr3_fr5_CO1 - OPP - curative" after CRA should be 585 MW
    And the relative margin on cnec "fr1_fr4_CO1 - curative" after CRA should be 578 MW
