Feature: US 4.3: manage AC/DC modes from configuration

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 4.3.1: secure with AC config
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic4/SL_ep4us3.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "SECURED"
    Then the worst margin is 38.0 A
    Then the remedial action "PRA_PST_BE" is used in preventive
    Then the tap of PstRangeAction "PRA_PST_BE" should be 4 in preventive

  @fast @rao @mock @ac @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 4.3.2: failure with AC config without fallback
    Given network file is "epic4/US4-3-TestCase12Nodes-diverging.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic4/SL_ep4us3.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic4/RaoParameters_posMargin_ampere_ac_divergence.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then the calculation fails
    And the execution details should be "Initial sensitivity analysis failed"

  @fast @rao @mock @dc @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 4.3.3: no failure with DC config
    Given network file is "common/TestCase12Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic4/SL_ep4us3.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_posMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then its security status should be "SECURED"
    Then the worst margin is 28.0 MW
    Then the remedial action "PRA_PST_BE" is used in preventive
    Then the tap of PstRangeAction "PRA_PST_BE" should be 4 in preventive
