  Scenario: US 13.4.1: Topological RA already applied in initial network : not available for optimization
    Given network file is "common/TestCase16Nodes.uct"

    When I launch search_tree_rao
    Then 0 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And 0 remedial actions are used after "co1_fr2_fr3_1" at "curative"
    And the worst margin is -522 A
    And the margin on cnec "FFR4AA1  DDE1AA1  1 - co1_fr2_fr3_1 - curative" after CRA should be -522 A
