Feature: US 91.11: optimize computations for SECURE stop criterion

  @fast @rao @mock @dc @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 91.11.1: Interrupt search tree depth early
    Given network file is "epic91/TestCase4Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic91/CBCORA_interrupt_search_tree.xml"
    Given configuration file is "epic91/RaoParameters_interrupt_search_tree.json"
    When I launch search_tree_rao at "2019-01-08 12:00" on preventive state
    Then 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "be1_fr1_N - preventive" after PRA should be 2340 A
