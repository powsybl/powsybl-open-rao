Feature: US 93.1: Redispatching actions

  @fast @rao @dc @redispatching @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 93.1.1.a: Extremely basic redispatching on 2 nodes network - maxMargin
  The objective is to maximize the min margin => shut down both generator
  Redispatching action's setpoint = 0, On FRR1AA1 -> setpoint * 1 = 0, on FRR2 -> setpoint * -1 = 0
    Given network file is "epic93/2Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic93/crac-93-1-1.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao
    And the initial margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" should be -700 MW
    Then 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "redispatchingAction" is used in preventive
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingAction" should be 0.0 MW in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" after PRA should be 300 MW

  @fast @rao @dc @redispatching @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 93.1.1.bis: Extremely basic redispatching on 2 nodes network - maxMargin - load
  Exact same situation but with loads instead of generator
    Given network file is "epic93/2Nodes_load.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic93/crac-93-1-1-load.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao
    And the initial margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" should be -700 MW
    Then 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "redispatchingAction" is used in preventive
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingAction" should be 0.0 MW in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" after PRA should be 300 MW

  @fast @rao @dc @redispatching @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 93.1.2: Extremely basic redispatching on 2 nodes network - minCost
  The initial setpoint is 1000, it is then updated to 300.0 (because the threshold of the line FR1 FR2 is 300)
  after optim => delta = 1000-300 = 700
  Total cost : 10 for activation + 50 x 700 MW shift = 35010
    Given network file is "epic93/2Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic93/crac-93-1-1.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic93/RaoParameters_minCost_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao
    Then 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "redispatchingAction" is used in preventive
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingAction" should be 300.0 MW in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" after PRA should be 0.0 MW
    And the value of the objective function after PRA should be 35010.0

  @fast @rao @dc @redispatching @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 93.1.3: Unbalanced redispatching
  Only one redispatching action available on FR1 and FR2 with a key equal to 1 and another to -0.7
  The sum of the key do not sum up to 1. It's impossible to respect injection balance constraint with a variation != 0.
  The RAO chose to not apply the action.
    Given network file is "epic93/3Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic93/crac-93-1-3.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao
    And the initial margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" should be -267 MW
    Then 0 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingAction" should be 1000.0 MW in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" after PRA should be -267.0 MW

  @fast @rao @dc @redispatching @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 93.1.4: Multiple redispatching actions keep network balanced - max min margin
  Both redispatching actions have distribution keys that do not sum to 0, the actions should be activated together and the result is
  optimal when all generators are shut down.
  Injection balance constraint is satisfied 1000*(1+1)-1000*(1+1)=0
    Given network file is "epic93/4Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic93/crac-93-1-4.json"
    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao
    Then 2 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "redispatchingActionFR1FR3" is used in preventive
    And the remedial action "redispatchingActionFR2FR4" is used in preventive
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingActionFR1FR3" should be 0.0 MW in preventive
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingActionFR2FR4" should be 0.0 MW in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" after PRA should be 500.0 MW

  @fast @rao @dc @redispatching @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 93.1.5: Multiple redispatching actions keep network balanced with more "complex" keys - min cost
  One redispatching action that act on two generators with keys 1 and -0.7 and one on one generator with key 0.6.
  Injection balance constraint is respected :
      - redispatchingActionFR1FR2: initial setpoint = 1000 = 1000/1 = -700/-0.7, final = 529 => delta- = 471
      - redispatchingActionFR3: initial setpoint = -300/0.6 = -500, final = -265 => delta+ = âˆ’235
      => 471*(1-0.7)-235*0.6 = 0.3 ~ 0
  Objective function breakdown: 10+471*50+10+235*50 = 35320
    Given network file is "epic93/3Nodes.uct"
    Given crac file is "epic93/crac-93-1-5.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic93/RaoParameters_minCost_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao
    And the initial margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" should be -267 MW
    Then 2 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingActionFR1FR2" should be 529.0 MW in preventive
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingActionFR3" should be -265.0 MW in preventive
    And the margin on cnec "cnecFr1Fr2Preventive" after PRA should be 0.0 MW
    And the value of the objective function after PRA should be 35320.0

  @fast @rao @dc @redispatching @preventive-only
  Scenario: US 93.1.6: Redispatching with disconnected generator
  A simple three nodes network where all the prod is on FFR2AA1 and all the load is on FFR1AA1.
  The generator FFR3AA1 is disconnected so the redispatchingActionFR3 won't be used so the RAO can't use redispatchingActionFR1 either
  because it won't be able to satisfy the injection balancing constraint.
    Given network file is "epic93/3Nodes_FFR3AA1_disconnected.xiidm"
    Given crac file is "epic93/crac-93-1-6.json"
    Given configuration file is "epic93/RaoParameters_minCost_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao
    And the initial setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingActionFR1" should be -1000.0
    And the setpoint of RangeAction "redispatchingActionFR1" should be -1000.0 MW in preventive
    And 0 remedial actions are used in preventive
