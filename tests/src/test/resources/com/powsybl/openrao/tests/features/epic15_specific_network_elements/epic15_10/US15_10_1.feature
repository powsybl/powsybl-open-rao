Feature: US 15.10.1: Modify voltage level topology as remedial action (2 nodes case)

  @fast @crac @mock
  Scenario: US 15.10.1.1: Import succeed on basic well defined case
    Given network file is "epic15/TestCase12Nodes_forCSE.uct"

    Given crac creation parameters file is "epic15/CseCracCreationParameters_15_10_1_1.json"
    When I import crac
    Then it should have the following network actions:
      | NetworkActionId | NetworkActionName | ElementaryActions | ElementaryActionType | NetworkElementId                        | Action/Setpoint |
      | Bus bar ok test | Bus bar ok test   | 4                 | SwitchPair           | BBE1AA1W BBE1AA11 1/BBE1AA1W BBE1AA12 1 | OPEN/CLOSE      |

    Then the remedial actions should have the following usage rules:
      | RemedialActionId | UsageRules | Rule      | Method    | Instant    | ContingencyId | FlowCnecId |
      | Bus bar ok test  | 1          | OnInstant | Available | preventive |               |            |

    Given configuration file is "common/RaoParameters_maxMargin_megawatt_dc.json"
    When I launch rao
    Then 1 remedial actions are used in preventive
    And the remedial action "RA1" is used in preventive
    And 2 remedial actions are used after "co1_fr2_fr3" at "curative"
    And the remedial action "RA2" is used after "co1_fr2_fr3" at "curative"
    And the remedial action "RA3" is used after "co1_fr2_fr3" at "curative"
    And the worst margin is -1080 MW
    And the margin on cnec "fr1_fr2_co1 - FFR1AA1 ->FFR2AA1   - co1_fr2_fr3 - curative" after CRA should be -1080 MW
    And the margin on cnec "fr2_fr3_n - FFR2AA1 ->FFR3AA1  - preventive" after PRA should be -397 MW
    And the margin on cnec "fr1_fr2_n - FFR1AA1 ->FFR2AA1  - preventive" after PRA should be -224 MW
    And the margin on cnec "fr2_fr3_co1 - FFR2AA1 ->FFR3AA1   - co1_fr2_fr3 - curative" after CRA should be 950 MW
