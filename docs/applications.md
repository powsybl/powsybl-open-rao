# Operational applications

Many operational applications involve optimising remedial actions for critical network elements; and these applications often need to achieve different goals.
The OpenRAO Toolbox can be used in a variety of cases thanks to the large scope of features it covers; its behaviour can be tuned using [configuration parameters](/parameters.md).

You can find examples of usages for OpenRAO below.
