# CRAC creation context

## Introduction
When OpenRAO tries to import a [CRAC object](json) from a business CRAC file ([FlowBasedConstraint](fbconstraint), [CSE](cse), 
[CIM](cim), ...) or from an older version of the [JSON](json) format, some data transformation can happen, and data 
present in the final CRAC object will not be a "one-to-one" exact representation of the data in the original file.  
This can be an issue for the final user, as [querying the RAO result file or object](/output-data/rao-result.md#contents-of-the-rao-result) 
needs knowledge of the artefacts OpenRAO created during CRAC creation.  
The `CracCreationContext` object produced by the CRAC importer allows the user to access meta-information 
about the CRAC creation process, and to map the original file to the created artifacts in the OpenRAO object, or to 
error messages if some objects could not be imported.  
This is particularly useful if the user needs to export the RAO result in a format different from [OpenRAO's internal format](/output-data/rao-result.md), 
and to reference CNECs and remedial actions as they were defined in the original (native) CRAC file.  
Many implementations of CracCreationContext exist, depending on the original format. Every implementation has its own 
specific API. CracCreationContext can be obtained with the `readWithContext` methods, but you have to 
explicitly cast it to its implementation, if you desire to access its class' specific methods.

## Non-specific information
All `CracCreationContext` implementations present the following information.

~~~{plantuml}
!include_many uml/CracCreationContext.puml!CracCreationContext
!include_many uml/CracCreationContext.puml!CracCreationReport
~~~

- **CRAC creation success**: a simple boolean set to true if a OpenRAO CRAC could be created from the native CRAC file.
- **CRAC**: the created CRAC object, to be used in the RAO.
- **Timestamp**: when applicable, this field contains the timestamp for which the CRAC has been created from the original CRAC file (as
  some CRAC formats, such as [FlowBasedConstraint](#flowbasedconstraint-implementation), can support constraint definition for multiple timestamps).  
  This field can be useful if the timestamp needs to be exported in a custom results file.
- **Network name**: contains the name of the network that was used to create the CRAC object.
- **CRAC creation report**: a textual report that can usefully be logged. It contains information about elements that were ignored or modified in the 
  original CRAC. The final user shall check these messages to ensure that their CRAC file is well-defined.  
  The report's lines all begin with one of these tags:
  - **[ERROR]**: happens when a CRAC could not be created (e.g. if the user tried to import a [FlowBasedConstraint](#flowbasedconstraint-implementation) 
  file without defining a timestamp, or a [CSE](#cse-implementation) file with a non-UCTE network file, etc.)
  - **[REMOVED]**: happens when OpenRAO ignores elements of the CRAC because they cannot be imported, or because they are not relevant 
  for the RAO (e.g. if a contingency is defined on an element that doesn't exist in the network, or if a CNEC is neither 
  optimized nor monitored, etc.)
  - **[ADDED]**: happens if OpenRAO decides to add elements that were not explicitly defined in the original file (e.g. if the 
  CRAC contains AUTO CNECs without any remedial action associated, OpenRAO will automatically duplicate them in the outage 
  instant in order to secure them during the preventive RAO)
  - **[ALTERED]**: happens if OpenRAO imports an element after altering it or ignoring some of its components (e.g. if a monitored 
  element shall be so after multiple contingencies, among which some were not imported for any reason, then only valid 
  contingencies will be used for the created CNECs)
  - **[WARN]**: non-critical warnings (e.g. if the user defined a timestamp for a CRAC format that doesn't require one, the 
  timestamp is ignored and a warning is logged)
  - **[INFO]**: non-critical information

## UCTE implementation
A common UCTE interface, `UcteCracCreationContext`, has been defined in order to collect the common fields a 
CracCreationContext implementation should hold when created using a **UCTE** network.  
Of course, not all CRAC formats use UCTE convention, so not all CRAC formats can implement this UCTE interface.  
Currently, this interface is implemented by [FlowBasedConstraint](#flowbasedconstraint-implementation) and 
[CSE](#cse-implementation) CRAC importers.  
It has all the [non-specific](#non-specific-information) features, plus the following.

### Branch CNEC creation contexts
The `BranchCnecCreationContext` contains information about the creation of CNECs in OpenRAO. One BranchCreationContext 
is created for every native CNEC-equivalent element in the original CRAC, that can be uniquely identified. It holds the 
following information:  
- **NativeId**: the unique identifier of the native object in the original CRAC. Depending on the CRAC implementation, 
OpenRAO can construct this by concatenating multiple elements in order to ensure the ID is unique in the file.
- **isImported**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO was able to import one or multiple CNECs from this element.
- **isAltered**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO had to alter some elements of this CNEC when importing it.
- **ImportStatus**: contains further information about the import status of the element (see [appendix](#elementary-import-status))
- **ImportStatusDetail**: a user-friendly message explaining why the element has not been imported (if applicable)
- **NativeBranch**: the UCTE branch referred to in the original CRAC, with a "from" node, a "to" node, and a suffix (order code or alias)
- **isBaseCase**: a boolean equal to true if the CNEC has been created for the preventive instant
- **ContingencyId** (if present): the ID of the contingency for which the CNEc is monitored
- **CreatedCnecIds**: the ID(s) of the OpenRAO CNEC(s) that were created for this native critical branch. These are the 
IDs the user should use to query the internal CRAC & RaoResult objects.
- **isDirectionInvertedInNetwork**: a boolean equal to true if the from/to in the original CRAC are the inverse of the 
PowSyBl network's from/to. This means that OpenRAO had to invert the branch when importing it (in order to be coherent with the network) 
as well as its flow constraints, and that the flow results in the RaoResult will be inverted in regard to the original CRAC's convention. 
The user should be careful to invert these results before exploiting them.   

Here is a complete example of BranchCnecCreationContext usage to export user-comprehensible RAO results:    
  
```java
UcteCracCreationContext ucteCracCreationContext = (UcteCracCreationContext) Crac.readWithContext( ...
RaoResult raoResult = ...
    
// Do a custom results export of all native CNEC results
ucteCracCreationContext.getBranchCnecCreationContexts().foreach(context -> printSomeResults(context, ucteCracCreationContext, raoResult));

// Query the results of a specific native CNEC called "BranchCnecFR_1"
BranchCnecCreationContext context = ucteCracCreationContext.getBranchCnecCreationContext("BranchCnecFR_1");
printSomeResults(context, ucteCracCreationContext, raoResult);

void printSomeResults(BranchCnecCreationContext context, CracCreationContext cracCreationContext, RaoResult raoResult) {
    System.out.println(String.format("Native critical branch ID: %s", context.getNativeId()));
    System.out.println(String.format("Native line: %s %s %s", context.getNativeBranch().getFrom(), context.getNativeBranch().getTo(), context.getNativeBranch().getSuffix()));
    if (!context.isImported()) {
        System.out.println(String.format("The native branch could not be imported by OpenRAO for the following reason: %s - %s", context.getImportStatus(), context.getImportStatusDetail()));
        System.out.println("The element has been ignored by the RAO, we cannot access any result for it!");
        return;
    }
    double flowMultiplier;
    if (context.isDirectionInvertedInNetwork()) {
        System.out.println(String.format("In the network the line is called %s %s %s, so all its results will be inverted!", context.getNativeBranch().getTo(), context.getNativeBranch().getFrom(), context.getNativeBranch().getSuffix()));
        flowMultiplier = -1.;
    } else {
        flowMultiplier = 1.;
    }
    if (context.isBaseCase()) {
        System.out.println("Monitored in preventive only");
    } else {
        System.out.println(String.format("Monitored after contingency: %s", context.getContingencyId().get()));
    }
    context.getCreatedCnecsIds().entrySet().forEach(entry -> {
            System.out.println(String.format("Created CNEC for instant %s: %s", entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()));
            FlowCnec flowCnec = cracCreationContext.getCrac().getFlowCnec(entry.getValue());
            System.out.println(String.format("The left-side flow on this native critical branch after RAO is: %.2f A", flowMultiplier * raoResult.getFlow(OptimizationState.afterOptimizing(flowCnec.getState()), flowCnec, TwoSides.ONE, Unit.AMPERE)));
            System.out.println(String.format("The right-side flow on this native critical branch after RAO is: %.2f A", flowMultiplier * raoResult.getFlow(OptimizationState.afterOptimizing(flowCnec.getState()), flowCnec, TwoSides.TWO, Unit.AMPERE)));
            System.out.println(String.format("The flow margin on this native critical branch after RAO is: %.2f A", raoResult.getMargin(OptimizationState.afterOptimizing(flowCnec.getState()), flowCnec, Unit.AMPERE)));
        }
    );
}
```

### Remedial action creation contexts
The `RemedialActionCreationContext` contains information about the creation of remedial actions in OpenRAO. One 
RemedialActionCreationContext is created for every native remedial-action element in the original CRAC, that can be 
uniquely identified. It holds the following information:
- **NativeId**: the unique identifier of the native object in the original CRAC. Depending on the CRAC implementation,
  OpenRAO can construct this by concatenating multiple elements in order to ensure the ID is unique in the file.
- **isImported**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO was able to import a remedial action from this element.
- **isAltered**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO had to alter some elements of this remedial action when importing it.
- **ImportStatus**: contains further information about the import status of the element (see [appendix](#elementary-import-status))
- **ImportStatusDetail**: a user-friendly message explaining why the element has not been imported (if applicable)
- **CreatedRAId**: the ID of the OpenRAO remedial action that was created from this native element. This is the 
  ID the user should use to query the internal CRAC & RaoResult objects.

Here is a complete example of RemedialActionCreationContext usage to export user-comprehensible RAO results:
  
```java
UcteCracCreationContext ucteCracCreationContext = ...
RaoResult raoResult = ...

// Do a custom results export of all native remedial action results
ucteCracCreationContext.getRemedialActionCreationContexts().foreach(context -> printSomeResults(context, ucteCracCreationContext, raoResult));

// Query the results of a specific native remedial action called "RemedialAction656"
RemedialActionCreationContext context = ucteCracCreationContext.getRemedialActionCreationContext("RemedialAction656");
printSomeResults(context, ucteCracCreationContext, raoResult);

void printSomeResults(RemedialActionCreationContext context, CracCreationContext cracCreationContext, RaoResult raoResult) {
    System.out.println(String.format("Native remedial action ID: %s", context.getNativeId()));
    if (!context.isImported()) {
        System.out.println(String.format("The remedial action could not be imported by OpenRAO for the following reason: %s - %s", context.getImportStatus(), context.getImportStatusDetail()));
        System.out.println("The element has been ignored by the RAO, we cannot access any result for it!");
        return;
    }
    System.out.println(String.format("The remedial action created in the OpenRAO CRAC is called: %s", context.getCreatedObjectId()));
    RemedialAction<?> remedialAction = cracCreationContext.getCrac().getRemedialAction(context.getCreatedObjectId());
    cracCreationContext.getCrac().getStates().forEach(state -> {
        String stateDescription = String.format("instant %s%s", state.getInstant(), state.isPreventive() ? "" : " after contingency " + state.getContingency().get().getId());
        if (raoResult.getActivatedNetworkActionsDuringState(state).contains(remedialAction)) {
            // Remedial action is a network action, it has been activated in this state 
            System.out.println(String.format("The network action has been selected by RAO at %s", stateDescription));
        } else if (raoResult.getActivatedRangeActionsDuringState(state).contains(remedialAction)) {
            // Remedial action is a range action, it has been activated in this state. We can query its optimal set-point.
            System.out.println(String.format("The range action has been selected by RAO at %s, with optimal set-point %.2f", stateDescription, raoResult.getOptimizedSetPointOnState(state, (RangeAction<?>) remedialAction)));
        }
    });
}
```

### Outage creation contexts
The `CseOutageCreationContext` contains information about the creation of contingencies in OpenRAO. One 
CseOutageCreationContext is created for every native "Outage" element in the original CSE CRAC, that can be uniquely 
identified. It holds the following information:
- **NativeId**: the unique identifier of the native Outage (contained in the "Name" tag)
- **isImported**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO was able to import a contingency from this element.
- **isAltered**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO had to alter some elements of this contingency when importing it.
- **ImportStatus**: contains further information about the import status of the element (see [appendix](#elementary-import-status))
- **ImportStatusDetail**: a user-friendly message explaining why the element has not been imported (if applicable)
- **CreatedContingencyId**: the ID of the OpenRAO contingency that was created from this native element. This is the
  ID the user should use to query the internal CRAC & RaoResult objects.

Here is a complete example of CseOutageCreationContext usage:
  
```java
CseCracCreationContext cseCracCreationContext = ...
RaoResult raoResult = ...

// Print some information about all native Outage elements
cseCracCreationContext.getOutageCreationContexts().foreach(context -> printSomeInformation(context, cseCracCreationContext, raoResult));

// Query the information about a specific Outage called "Outage123"
CseOutageCreationContext context = cseCracCreationContext.getRemedialActionCreationContext("Outage123");
printSomeInformation(context, cseCracCreationContext, raoResult);

void printSomeInformation(CseOutageCreationContext context, CracCreationContext cracCreationContext, RaoResult raoResult) {
    System.out.println(String.format("Native outage ID: %s", context.getNativeId()));
    if (!context.isImported()) {
        System.out.println(String.format("The outage could not be imported by OpenRAO for the following reason: %s - %s", context.getImportStatus(), context.getImportStatusDetail()));
        System.out.println("The element has been ignored by the RAO, we cannot access any more information for it!");
        return;
    }
    System.out.println(String.format("The contingency created in the OpenRAO CRAC is called: %s", context.getCreatedContingencyId()));
    Contingency contingency = cracCreationContext.getCrac().getContingency(context.getCreatedContingencyId());
    cracCreationContext.getCrac().getStates(contingency).forEach(state -> {
        System.out.println(String.format("The contingency is monitored at instant %s", state.getInstant()));
        System.out.println(String.format("At this instant, and after this contingency, %s CNECs are monitored by the RAO", cracCreationContext.getCrac().getCnecs(state).size()));
    });

CimCracCreationContext cimCracCreationContext = ...
RaoResult raoResult = ...

// Print some information about all native Contingency_Series elements
cimCracCreationContext.getContingencyCreationContexts().foreach(context -> printSomeInformation(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult));

// Query the information about a specific Contingency_Series with mRID "CO-125"
RemedialActionCreationContext context = cimCracCreationContext.getContingencyCreationContextById("CO-125");
printSomeInformation(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult);

// Query the information about a specific Contingency_Series with name "N-1 on FR-ES branch"
RemedialActionCreationContext context = cimCracCreationContext.getContingencyCreationContextByName("N-1 on FR-ES branch");
printSomeInformation(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult);

void printSomeInformation(CimContingencyCreationContext context, CracCreationContext cracCreationContext, RaoResult raoResult) {
    System.out.println(String.format("Native Contingency_Series ID: %s", context.getNativeId()));
    System.out.println(String.format("Native Contingency_Series name: %s", context.getNativeName()));
    if (!context.isImported()) {
        System.out.println(String.format("The Contingency_Series could not be imported by OpenRAO for the following reason: %s - %s", context.getImportStatus(), context.getImportStatusDetail()));
        System.out.println("The element has been ignored by the RAO, we cannot access any more information for it!");
        return;
    }
    System.out.println(String.format("The contingency created in the OpenRAO CRAC is called: %s", context.getCreatedContingencyId()));
    Contingency contingency = cracCreationContext.getCrac().getContingency(context.getCreatedContingencyId());
    cracCreationContext.getCrac().getStates(contingency).forEach(state -> {
        System.out.println(String.format("The contingency is monitored at instant %s", state.getInstant()));
        System.out.println(String.format("At this instant, and after this contingency, %s CNECs are monitored by the RAO", cracCreationContext.getCrac().getCnecs(state).size()));
    });
}
```

### Monitored series creation contexts
The `MonitoredSeriesCreationContext` 
contains information about the creation of CNECs in OpenRAO. One MonitoredSeriesCreationContext is created for every native 
[B57](cim.md#flowcnecs) "Monitored_Series" in the original CRAC, that can be uniquely identified. It holds the following information:

- **MeasurementCreationContexts**: a set  of `MeasurementCreationContext`
  objects. One MeasurementCreationContexts is created for every "Measurements" tag inside the Monitored_Series. In fact,
  one "Measurement" can create multiple OpenRAO CNECs, depending on the contingencies and instants defined for the
  Monitored_Series in the CIM CRAC (see [here](cim.md#flowcnecs) fore more detail). Every MeasurementCreationContext 
  contains the following information:
  - **isImported**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO was able to import at least one CNEC from this "Measurements".
  - **ImportStatus**: contains further information about the import status of the element (see [appendix](#elementary-import-status))
  - **ImportStatusDetail**: a user-friendly message explaining why the element has not been imported (if applicable)
  - **CnecCreationContexts**: a map containing, for every state (i.e. (Instant, Contingency) pair), up to one 
    `CnecCreationContext`. Every CnecCreationContext holds the following information:
    - **isImported**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO was able to import a CNEC from this "Measurements", for the given contingency & instant.
    - **ImportStatus**: contains further information about the import status of the element (see [appendix](#elementary-import-status))
    - **CreatedCnecIds**: the ID of the OpenRAO CNEC that was created (if applicable) from this "Measurements", for
      the given contingency & instant. This is the ID the user should use to query the internal CRAC & RaoResult objects.

Here is a complete example of MonitoredSeriesCreationContext usage to export user-comprehensible RAO results:

```java
CimCracCreationContext cimCracCreationContext = ...
RaoResult raoResult = ...
    
// Do a custom results export of all native Monitored_Series results
cimCracCreationContext.getMonitoredSeriesCreationContexts().foreach(context -> printSomeResults(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult));

// Query the results of a specific Monitored_Series with mRID "MR-10"
MonitoredSeriesCreationContext context = cimCracCreationContext.getMonitoredSeriesCreationContext("MR-10");
printSomeResults(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult);

void printSomeResults(MonitoredSeriesCreationContext context, CracCreationContext cracCreationContext, RaoResult raoResult) {
    System.out.println(String.format("Native Monitored_Series ID & name: %s - %s", context.getNativeId(), context.getNativeName()));
    System.out.println(String.format("Monitored network element ID & name: %s - %s", context.getNativeResourceId(), context.getNativeResourceName()));
    if (!context.isImported()) {
        System.out.println(String.format("The Monitored_Series could not be imported by OpenRAO for the following reason: %s - %s", context.getImportStatus(), context.getImportStatusDetail()));
        System.out.println("The element has been ignored by the RAO, we cannot access any result for it!");
        return;
    }
    System.out.println(String.format("This Monitored_Series created %s CNECs in the OpenRAO CRAC", context.getCreatedCnecIds().size()));
    context.getMeasurementCreationContexts().forEach(measurementContext -> {
        if (!measurementContext.isImported()) {
            System.out.println(String.format("One Measurement has not been imported for the following reason: %s - %s", measurementContext.getImportStatus(), measurementContext.getImportStatusDetail()));
        } else {
            measurementContext.getCnecCreationContexts().forEach((k, v) -> {
                if (v.isImported()) {
                    System.out.println(String.format("Created CNEC ID for instant %s, after contingency %s, is %s", k.getKey(1), k.getKey(0), v.getCreatedCnecId()));
                    FlowCnec flowCnec = cracCreationContext.getCrac().getFlowCnec(v.getCreatedCnecId());
                    System.out.println(String.format("Its flow margin after RAO is: %.2f MW", raoResult.getMargin(OptimizationState.afterOptimizing(flowCnec.getState()), flowCnec, Unit.MEGAWATT)));

                    System.out.println(String.format("The CNEC could not be created for instant %s, after contingency %s, for the following reason: %s - %s", k.getKey(1), k.getKey(0), v.getImportStatus(), v.getImportStatusDetail()));
                }
            });
        }
    });
}
```

### Angle CNEC creation contexts
The `AngleCnecCreationContext` 
contains information about the creation of angle CNECs in OpenRAO. One AngleCnecCreationContext is created for every native
[B56](cim.md#anglecnecs) "AdditionalConstraint_Series" in the original CRAC, that can be uniquely identified. 
It holds the following information:
- **NativeId**: the unique identifier of the native AdditionalConstraint_Series (contained in the "mRID" tag)
- **isImported**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO was able to import one or multiple CNECs from this element.
- **ImportStatus**: contains further information about the import status of the element (see [appendix](#elementary-import-status))
- **ImportStatusDetail**: a user-friendly message explaining why the element has not been imported (if applicable)
- **CreatedCnecId**: the ID of the OpenRAO angle CNEC that was created for this AdditionalConstraint_Series. 
  This is the ID the user should use to query the internal CRAC & RaoResult objects.
- **ContingencyId**: the ID of the contingency for this angle CNEC. It can be used with internal objects.

Here is a complete example of AngleCnecCreationContext usage to export user-comprehensible RAO results:

```java
CimCracCreationContext cimCracCreationContext = ...
RaoResult raoResult = ...
    
// Do a custom results export of all native AdditionalConstraint_Series results
cimCracCreationContext.getAngleCnecCreationContexts().foreach(context -> printSomeResults(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult));

// Query the results of a specific AdditionalConstraint_Series with mRID "AC-100"
AngleCnecCreationContext context = cimCracCreationContext.getAngleCnecCreationContext("AC-100");
printSomeResults(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult);

void printSomeResults(AngleCnecCreationContext context, CracCreationContext cracCreationContext, RaoResult raoResult) {
    System.out.println(String.format("AdditionalConstraint_Series ID: %s", context.getNativeId()));

    // Print its angle value (note that this will not work with the default search-tree RAO implementation)

### Voltage CNEC creation contexts
The `VoltageCnecCreationContext`
contains information about the creation of angle CNECs in OpenRAO. One VoltageCnecCreationContext is created for every voltage
CNEC that should be created, as configured in the [CimCracCreationParameters](creation-parameters.md#voltage-cnecs-creation-parameters). 
It holds the following information:
- **NativeNetworkElementId**: the unique identifier of the network element that is monitored
- **Instant**: the instant for which the CNEC is created
- **NativeContingencyName**: the name of the contingency for which the CNEC is created (if instant is not preventive), 
  as defined in the "name" field of the [B55](cim.md#contingencies) Contingency_Series
- **isImported**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO was able to import the voltage CNEC
- **ImportStatus**: contains further information about the import status of the element (see [appendix](#elementary-import-status))
- **ImportStatusDetail**: a user-friendly message explaining why the element has not been imported (if applicable)
- **CreatedCnecId**: the ID of the OpenRAO voltage CNEC that was created. 
  This is the ID the user should use to query the internal CRAC & RaoResult objects.

Here is a complete example of VoltageCnecCreationContext usage to export user-comprehensible RAO results:

```java
CimCracCreationContext cimCracCreationContext = ...
RaoResult raoResult = ...
    
// Do a custom results export of all voltage CNECs results
cimCracCreationContext.getVoltageCnecCreationContexts().foreach(context -> printSomeResults(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult));

// Query the results of a specific voltage CNEC that was created for network element "ne1", at instant "curative", after contingency "co1"
VoltageCnecCreationContext context = cimCracCreationContext.getVoltageCnecCreationContext("ne1", Instant.CURATIVE, "co1");
printSomeResults(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult);

void printSomeResults(VoltageCnecCreationContext context, CracCreationContext cracCreationContext, RaoResult raoResult) {
    System.out.println(String.format("Voltage CNEC for network element %s after contingency %s at instant %s", context.getNativeNetworkElementId(), context.getNativeContingencyName(), context.getInstant()));
    if (!context.isImported()) {
        System.out.println(String.format("The voltage CNEC could not be imported by OpenRAO for the following reason: %s - %s", context.getImportStatus(), context.getImportStatusDetail()));
        System.out.println("The element has been ignored by the RAO, we cannot access any result for it!");
        return;
    }
    System.out.println(String.format("The voltage CNEC created in the OpenRAO CRAC is called: %s", String.join(", ", context.getCreatedCnecId())));
    VoltageCnec voltageCnec = cracCreationContext.getCrac().getVoltageCnec(context.getCreatedCnecId());
    // Print its voltage value (note that this will not work with the default search-tree RAO implementation)
    System.out.println(String.format("Its max voltage value after RAO is: %.2f", raoResult.getVoltage(OptimizationState.afterOptimizing(voltageCnec.getState()), voltageCnec, MinOrMax.MAX, Unit.KILOVOLT)));
}
```

### Remedial action series creation contexts
The CIM `RemedialActionSeriesCreationContext`
contains information about the creation of remedial actions in OpenRAO. One RemedialActionSeriesCreationContext is created for every
[B56](cim.md#remedial-actions) "RemedialAction_Series" element in the original CRAC, that can be uniquely identified. 
It holds the following information:
- **NativeId**: the unique identifier of the native RemedialAction_Series (contained in the "mRID" tag)
- **isImported**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO was able to import a remedial action from this element.
- **isAltered**: a boolean equal to true if OpenRAO had to alter some elements of this remedial action when importing it.
- **ImportStatus**: contains further information about the import status of the element (see [appendix](#elementary-import-status))
- **ImportStatusDetail**: a user-friendly message explaining why the element has not been imported (if applicable)
- **isInverted**: a boolean equal to true if the imported remedial action had to be inverted with regard to the original
  CRAC convention, in order to comply with the PowSyBl network convention (this is especially useful for HVDC range actions).
  If this field is set to true, the user should be careful to invert results accordingly (see example below).
- **CreatedIds**: the IDs of the OpenRAO remedial actions that were created from this native element (generally holds up
  to one ID, except for HVDC range actions where it can hold multiple IDs). These are the IDs the user should use to query
  the internal CRAC & RaoResult objects.

Here is a complete example of RemedialActionSeriesCreationContext usage to export user-comprehensible RAO results:

```java
CimCracCreationContext cimCracCreationContext = ...
RaoResult raoResult = ...

// Do a custom results export of all native remedial action results
cimCracCreationContext.getRemedialActionSeriesCreationContexts().foreach(context -> printSomeResults(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult));

// Query the results of a specific RemedialAction_Series with mRID "PRA_5"
RemedialActionSeriesCreationContext context = cimCracCreationContext.getRemedialActionSeriesCreationContext("PRA_5");
printSomeResults(context, cimCracCreationContext, raoResult);

void printSomeResults(RemedialActionSeriesCreationContext context, CracCreationContext cracCreationContext, RaoResult raoResult) {
    System.out.println(String.format("RemedialAction_Series ID: %s", context.getNativeId()));
    if (!context.isImported()) {
        System.out.println(String.format("The remedial action could not be imported by OpenRAO for the following reason: %s - %s", context.getImportStatus(), context.getImportStatusDetail()));
        System.out.println("The element has been ignored by the RAO, we cannot access any result for it!");
        return;
    }
    System.out.println(String.format("The remedial action(s) created in the OpenRAO CRAC is (are) called: %s", String.join(", ", context.getCreatedIds())));
    context.getCreatedIds().forEach(createdRaId -> {
        System.out.println(String.format("Remedial action %s:", createdRaId));
        RemedialAction<?> remedialAction = cracCreationContext.getCrac().getRemedialAction(createdRaId);
        cracCreationContext.getCrac().getStates().forEach(state -> {
            String stateDescription = String.format("instant %s%s", state.getInstant(), state.isPreventive() ? "" : " after contingency " + state.getContingency().get().getId());
            if (raoResult.getActivatedNetworkActionsDuringState(state).contains(remedialAction)) {
                // Remedial action is a network action, it has been activated in this state
                System.out.println(String.format("The network action has been selected by RAO at %s", stateDescription));
            } else if (raoResult.getActivatedRangeActionsDuringState(state).contains(remedialAction)) {
                // Remedial action is a range action, it has been activated in this state. We can query its optimal set-point.
                int multiplier = context.isInverted() ? -1 : 1;
                System.out.println(String.format("The range action has been selected by RAO at %s, with optimal set-point %.2f", stateDescription, multiplier * raoResult.getOptimizedSetPointOnState(state, (RangeAction<?>) remedialAction)));
            }
        });
    });
}
```

## JSON implementation

The JsonCracCreationContext is a basic implementation of CracCreationContext.  
Since the [JSON](json) format is OpenRAO's native format, not much transformation is made when importing a json CRAC 
file; thus, in most cases, the JSON CRAC creation context is not much of a use.  
However, the importer does not throw exceptions, so it is important to check its success flag.  
In the future, the object may evolve to contain information about transformations made in the rare cases where the user 
imports an old version of the JSON file, where some transformations are needed.

`ImportStatus` is an enumeration that can be used in the API to filter elements that were not imported for different reasons.  
For instance, the user may choose to write information about CNECs that were not imported because they are not useful in 
the RAO ("NOT_FOR_RAO"), but ignore the other ones.  
Here are the possible values of this enum:
- **IMPORTED**: the element was successfully imported
- **ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND_IN_NETWORK**: the element references a network element that was not found in the network (e.g. a 
critical branch defined on a line that does not exist in the PowSyBl network)
- **INCOMPLETE_DATA**: the element is missing crucial information needed to define a complete OpenRAO object (e.g. a flow 
CNEC defined without a flow limit)
- **INCONSISTENCY_IN_DATA**: the element definition is inconsistent (e.g. a PST range action that is defined on a non-PST 
network element)
- **NOT_YET_HANDLED_BY_OPEN_RAO**: the business element is not yet supported by OpenRAO (e.g. line impedance remedial-actions 
are not yet supported)
- **NOT_FOR_RAO**: the element is ignored because it will not be used in the RAO (e.g. critical branches that are neither 
optimized nor monitored)
- **NOT_FOR_REQUESTED_TIMESTAMP**: the element is ignored because it does not apply to the given timestamp
- **OTHER**: any error that does not fall into one of the categories above
