# ICS

ICS data contains necessary data to define redispatching actions' specific constraints. ICS data are only used for 
[costly computations](../../algorithms/castor/linear-problem/costly-specific.md)

### Static
Static ICS data defines a remedial action's generator's static constraints:

### Series

This CSV defines a remedial action's generator's operating program P0, and allowed undershoot/overshoot
from P0 (RDP- and RDP+, positive values). These values are defined as time series over 24 hours.

### GSK

| Name   | Details                                                                                  |

| Node   | UCT code of the node described with 8 characters.                                        |
| Weight | Weight for GSK at respective node.  Sum of weights for all nodes in one GSK should be 1. |
