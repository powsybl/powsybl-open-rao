# MNECs

## Definition

MNECs (Monitored Network Elements) are monitored rather than optimised,
see [Optimised and monitored CNECs](/input-data/crac/json.md#optimised-and-monitored-cnecs)
Their margin must be kept positive or above its initial value.

## Implementation

MNEC constraints are modelled in the RAO under the linear problem
as [MNEC constraints](/castor/linear-problem/mnec-filler.md).
