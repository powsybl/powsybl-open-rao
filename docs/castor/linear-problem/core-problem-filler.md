| sensitivityThreshold |                    | Set to zero the sensitivities of RangeActions below this threshold; thus avoiding the activation of RangeActions which have too small an impact on the flows (can also be achieved with penaltyCost). This simplifies & speeds up the resolution of the optimization problem (can be necessary when the problem contains integer variables). However, it also adds an approximation in the computation of the flows within the MILP, which can be tricky to handle when the MILP contains hard constraints on loop-flows or monitored FlowCnecs. | Equal to [pst-sensitivity-threshold](/parameters.md#pst-sensitivity-threshold) for PSTs, [hvdc-sensitivity-threshold](/parameters.md#hvdc-sensitivity-threshold) for HVDCs, and [injection-ra-sensitivity-threshold](/parameters.md#injection-ra-sensitivity-threshold) for injection range actions |
| penaltyCost          | $c^{penalty}_{ra}$ | Supposedly a small penalization, in the use of the RangeActions. When several solutions are equivalent, this favours the one with the least change in the RangeActions' setpoints (compared to the initial situation).

[^2]: Range actions' lower & upper bounds are computed using CRAC + network + previous RAO results, depending on the
types of their ranges: ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE_TO_INITIAL_NETWORK, RELATIVE_TO_PREVIOUS_INSTANT (more
information [here](/input-data/crac/json.md#range-actions))

## Defined constraints

### Impact of rangeActions on FlowCnecs flows

$$
\begin{equation}
F(c) = f_{n}(c) + \sum_{r \in \mathcal{RA(s)}} \sigma_n (r,c,s) * [A(r,s) - \alpha_{n}(r,s)] , \forall (c) \in
\mathcal{C}
\end{equation}
$$

with $s$ the state on $c$ which is evaluated

<br>

### Definition of the setpoint variations of the RangeActions

$$
\begin{equation}
A(r,s) = A(r,s') + \Delta^{+}(r,s) - \Delta^{-}(r,s) , \forall (r,s) \in \mathcal{RA}
\end{equation}
$$

with $A(r,s')$ the setpoint of the last range action on the same element as $r$ but a state preceding $s$. If none such
range actions exists, then $A(r,s') = \alpha_{0}(r)$

This equation always applies, except for PSTs when modeling them as [APPROXIMATED_INTEGERS](/parameters.md#pst-model).
If so, this constraint will be modeled directly via PST taps, see [here](/castor/linear-problem/discrete-pst-tap-filler.md#rangeactions-relative-tap-variations) as it gives better results [^3].

<br>

[^3]: Relative bounds are originally in tap.
When converting them in angle, we take the smallest angle step between two tap changes.
Despite artificially tightening the bounds, this is the only way to ensure we respect the tap limits as the tap to angle map is non linear.  
With PST modeled as APPROXIMATED_INTEGERS, we can directly use the taps and therefore avoid this approximation.

### Definition of the absolute variations of the RangeActions

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta A(r,s) = \Delta^{+}(r,s) + \Delta^{-}(r,s) , \forall (r,s) \in \mathcal{RA}
\end{equation}
$$

### Shrinking the allowed range

If parameter [ra-range-shrinking](/parameters.md#ra-range-shrinking) is enabled, the allowed range for range actions
is shrunk after each iteration according to the following constraints:

$$
\begin{equation}
t = UB(A(r,s)) - LB(A(r,s))
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
A(r,s) \geq A_{n-1}(r,s) - (\frac{2}{3})^{n}*t
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
A(r,s) \leq A_{n-1}(r,s) + (\frac{2}{3})^{n}*t
\end{equation}
$$

The value $\frac{2}{3}$ has been chosen to force the linear problem convergence while allowing the RA to go
back to its initial solution if needed.

## Contribution to the objective function

Small penalisation for the use of RangeActions:

$$
\begin{equation}
\min \sum_{r,s \in \mathcal{RA}} (c^{penalty}_{ra}(r) \Delta A(r,s))
\end{equation}
$$
